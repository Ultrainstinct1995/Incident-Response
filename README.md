# Incident-Response


## Introduction

In this project, I conducted an incident response investigation focused on addressing alerts and potential security breaches targeting my VM infrastructure. By intentionally triggering alerts and simulating intrusion attempts, I created a controlled environment to understand incident response processes firsthand.

Throughout the project, I documented each step of the incident response lifecycle, from detection to mitigation. I assessed the severity of each case and devised response strategies in collaboration with security teams and system administrators.

Ultimately, this project provided practical experience in incident response, equipping me with the skills to detect, respond to, and mitigate security incidents effectively.

The showcased metrics include the steps of part 2 of the Detection and Analysis phase and also following the incident response playbook if further action requires it for the Containment, Eradication and Recovery phase. 



## First and Foremost! I took the initative to always prepare and i have already did that following ingestion in the Log analytics in my azure account.


## Step 1

In this image, I've configured parameters to track a potential threat: a Brute Force Attack SUCCESS on my VM. By setting the owner, status, and severity, I'm ensuring a thorough investigation. With the owner as myself, I oversee the investigation and coordinate responses. The status keeps me updated on progress, while severity helps prioritize actions based on threat impact. This proactive approach demonstrates my commitment to securing my VM environment and mitigating risks effectively.




## Step 2

I took the initiative to review and investigate the issue firsthand. With meticulous attention to detail, I ensure thorough scrutiny of critical information, such as the IP address and host details of the computer involved etc. Additionally, I carefully track the frequency of attempted breaches to gain insights into the severity and persistence of the threat posed by the host attempting unauthorized access.
